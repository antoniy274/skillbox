When he entered the national political arena, he was seen as a rising star in the Republican Party.

He beat then-President Donald Trump's endorsed candidate in the Republican primary, and went on to roundly defeat his Democratic rival in the general election in 2020.

But Mr Cawthorn, who was partially paralysed in a car accident in 2014, quickly attracted controversy.

The former real estate investor and motivational speaker faced backlash from his own party after claiming in a March interview that fellow lawmakers had invited him to orgies, and he had seen them taking cocaine.

He was also accused of denying medical and family leave to a former congressional staff member before firing her - which he denied.

House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the top congressional Republican, recently said Mr Cawthorn had to "turn himself around".

"I just told him he's lost my trust, and he's going to have to earn it back," Mr McCarthy said.
