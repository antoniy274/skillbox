All organisms have their own specialized patterns like face appearances. 
The molecular patterns are grasped by specific pattern-understanding molecules called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). 
Likewise, pathogen-related stimuli are recognized through the specific transmembrane receptors of the host cells, 
PRRs, present on the cell surfaces of adaptive and innate immune systems in hosts. 
PRRs are responsible for sensing the incidence of any cell damage as well as the presence of infecting microorganisms. 
So, they recognize endogenous molecules derived from cellular damages or internal injuries, called DAMPs, 
as well as evolution-based structures surfaced on microbes, termed PAMPs. CTL or CLR is a pathogen and antigen receptor on DCs. 
DCs are specially recognize pathogens in the regulation of immune responses to protect the host from external environments. 
DCs are also engaged in homoeostatic regulation, recognizing self-antigens to allow tolerance from the tissue environment. 
Therefore, one question is how the nature of the recognized antigens takes the balance between immunity and tolerance. 
CLRs expressed on DCs substantially recognize and bind glycosylated self-antigens and pathogens. 
It is currently becoming deciphered that the CLRs serve as antigen receptors potentiating internalization to present antigens 
and as recognition receptors of glycosylated self-antigens to function as adhesion and signaling molecules. 
Thus, C-type lectins are accurately expressed depending on maturation stimuli. 
One of the well-known CLRs represent DC-SIGN that recognizes high-mannose types and Lewis antigens of Lex, LeY, LeB, and LeA. 
Another CLR, macrophage Gal and GalNAc-specific C-type lectin (MGL) recognizes GalNAc. 
From the fact that the glycan structures of antigenic epitope enhance MHC-I responses and the antigen-reactive CTLsâ€™ functions, 
it is considered that glycosylated antigen specifically interacts with C-type lectin to induce antigen-specific T-cell functions. 
Consequently, C-type lectin-recognized antigens can regulate T-cell polarization. 
The CLRs stimulate DCs signaling events with TLR activation. 
Understanding the CTLs on DCs and the carbohydrate-specific recognition structures of 
DCs will greatly help us to comprehend pathogen recognition in diseases. 
In addition, because tissue tumors frequently express LeX LeY and GalNAc glycan structures, 
the information can also help to understand how DCs regulate cellular tumor immunity through cellular interactions.
